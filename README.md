# Homey App for Maplin RF Sockets


# This app supports Maplin RF Sockets
 
# Current Features  
  Tuning on and off plugs and lamps  
  
# Usage
  Only need to add one remote as all the remotes send the same signal and do not have any specific address
  For plug sockets choose the channel and unit as per the dials on the back of the plug sockets.  The sockets can be     controlled in a flow on a different channel to the remote if needed.
  
  You can also use the remote for other types of actions in flows.
